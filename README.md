# Diabetes-Prediction in Pregnant Women
It is the Machine Learning based project which predicts the diabetes in pregnant women.
I have used the Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD) which is sourced from UCI machine learning repository. 
I have used six machine learning algorithms and choose the one with best results.
The performances of all the three algorithms are evaluated on various measures like Precision,Accuracy, F-Measure, and Recall. Accuracy is measured over correctly and incorrectly classified instance.
